\HymnTitle[Author Unknown]{Amazing Grace}

\begin{stanza}
Amazing grace! how sweet the sound,\\
That saved a wretch like me!\\
I once was lost, but now am found,\\
Was blind, but now I see.
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
’Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,\\
And grace my fears relieved;\\
How precious did that grace appear\\
The hour I first believed!
\end{stanza}

\begin{chorus}
Hallelujah, grace has found me,\\
Guiding light so pure and true.
\end{chorus}

\HymnTitle[John Newton]{Faith's Light}

\begin{stanza}
Through every trial, storm, and test,\\
God’s light within shall give me rest.\\
Though darkness falls, my path is clear,\\
His gentle voice I always hear.
\end{stanza}
