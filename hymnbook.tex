\HymnTitleWithNumber{1.}{Amazing Grace}

\begin{stanza}
1. Amazing grace! how sweet the sound,\\
That saved a wretch like me!
I once was lost, but now am found,\\
Was blind, but now I see.
\end{stanza}

\begin{stanza}
â€™Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,\\
And grace my fears relieved;\\
How precious did that grace appear\\
The hour I first believed!
\end{stanza}

\begin{chorus}
Hallelujah, grace has found me,\\
Guiding light so pure and true.
\end{chorus}
